This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Hackathon Submission Note

- **Vercel Link**: [https://furniro-ecommerce-project.vercel.app/](https://furniro-ecommerce-project.vercel.app/)

Sir Ameen Alam, I have successfully completed the hackathon within 24 hours. However, there was an issue with the Vercel link in the submission form. Initially, I submitted a Vercel link that has since been deleted from my Vercel dashboard. I have now created a new link for the project: [https://furniro-ecommerce-project.vercel.app/](https://furniro-ecommerce-project.vercel.app/).

Please consider this updated link as the official submission. I assure you that I dedicated 24 hours of hard work to this project, and the issue was only with the Vercel link. Kindly do not subtract any points for this minor oversight. Thank you!
